🚀 **TeamUp – Revolutionizing Hackathon Management**
🤝 Collaborate smarter. Compete better.

Excited to share **TeamUp**, a project I recently built — a **one-stop web app for managing hackathons** with ease, automation, and a modern UI.

💡 **The Motivation**
Being part of the Instrument Society of India (ISOI), VIT Vellore, I saw how hackathons were managed manually using Google Forms and spreadsheets. This was time-consuming, error-prone, and limited the overall experience. I wanted to build something that **streamlines the entire process** — making hackathons more engaging for participants and hassle-free for organizers.

🛠️ **What It Does**

* 🔐 OTP-based authentication for secure signup & login
* 👥 Team creation, joining, adding & removing members
* 📂 Upload, download & delete files with ease
* 🏆 Real-time leaderboard for live scoring
* 📊 Admin dashboard to monitor teams, view documents & update scores
* 🎮 A clean, dark-themed UI with a coding/gaming vibe for a tech-first experience

🌍 **Use Case**
TeamUp is built to **redefine the hackathon journey** — empowering participants with smooth collaboration while giving organizers powerful tools for real-time monitoring and scoring. It replaces fragmented tools with a **single, unified platform**.

✅ **Closing Note**
This project reflects my passion for building impactful, scalable solutions that simplify real-world problems. Would love to hear your thoughts and feedback!

Do you want me to make the **tagline under TeamUp (🤝 Collaborate smarter. Compete better.)** more **gaming/coding themed** (to match your dark UI vibe), or keep it professional and product-like?
